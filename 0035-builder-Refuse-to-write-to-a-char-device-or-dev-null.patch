Subject: [PATCH] builder: Refuse to write to a char device or /dev/null.

virt-builder --output /dev/null is tempting, but not possible, and
might result in /dev/null being deleted(!)  Check for this case and
prevent it happening.

(cherry picked from commit 3cf5a25e3f63ea6832b96468a94cdb13dbd26e92)
