+=head2 LANGUAGE
+
+Most Linux distributions support multiple locale settings so that you
+can have guest messages printed in another language such as Russian.
+However there is no single setting which controls this, since extra
+packages may need to be installed to support console and X fonts and
+keyboard input methods.  The packages required, and their
+configuration is highly distro-specific, and it is outside the scope
+of virt-builder to do this.
